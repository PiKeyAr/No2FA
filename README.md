# No2FA
No two-factor Auth requirements

GitHub, let me decide how I want my account secured. 

2FA is NOT "more secure" than a good password.

It's just another layer of crap to get logged in.

My projects will upload to Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/u/howtophil

and Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/prhoades/

***Note**: Seems that some are forking this and modifying it to point to their new locations.
Sounds like a good plan to me. You can direct people to a new place and show
that you are against forced 2FA nonsense.*
